Studying in Rotterdam is a chapter of your life that you will never forget! Do what makes you happy, strive for (academic) excellence, and enjoy all the little things that are part of your student experience. Before you lays an amazing opportunity to experience (a) great year(s), learn a lot, and meet friends for life! Time will fly and before you know it you have graduated and you’re applying for jobs. Until then, make the most of your student life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why we exist?</strong> <em>International Students Rotterdam (ISR)</em> was brought to life in the summer of 2011 because we wanted to improve the lives of all international students in Rotterdam; we wanted to create a Rotterdam that all international students can call home. We noticed that integrating into Dutch society can be difficult and we wanted to change that. We exist to make student life as an international easier and more enjoyable; we believe that Rotterdam is a beautiful city – full of opportunities – and we want our fellow international students to enjoy it as much as we do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What we do?</strong> We aim to be the platform that brings students together and helps them integrate into Dutch society. Our vision is to create a Rotterdam where all international students feel at home. All our activities can be divided into three categories. First, we try to connect students by organizing events. These events can mostly be classified as social, academic, cultural or sports and attempt to cover all aspects of student life; the upcoming year we will organize more than 50 events. Second, we aim to link students to organizations of their interest. This we do by attaching valuable organizations to our member’s card, offering our members exclusive deals or discounts throughout the city. Third, we aim to inform students about all the relevant matters regarding student life. We do this through our website and through this student guide that we write every year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Join the Family</strong>. We represent more than 30 different cultures and what brings us together is that – just like you – we are international students in Rotterdam. As an international student you are one of us; ISR is your international family! </p>\n\n<p>We have all been through the process of integrating into a new country, culture and language. ISR’s network and services has helped us throughout this process. Any time you have a question or need some help, there is always an ISR member ready to help you out!</p>\n\n<p>The upcoming year we will organize more than 50 events. Think of social drinks, personal development workshops, parties, festivals, company visits, sports tournaments, case competitions, food tastings, and more! These events are organized for you, so join one of our events to see how you can benefit from joining the family.</p>\n\n<p>We are international students in Rotterdam, we are in this together!

In fact, Holland counts over 18 million bikes for a mere 17 million Nederlanders, which is a pretty good indication of how silly for bikes the Dutch are. As an international student, one of your first steps should be laying claim to your first bike. Bikes are a great way of getting around and can save you a bunch of money on public transportation. If you are worried about safety, don’t fret: marked bike lanes are very common, and Dutch drivers are perfectly used to having bikes on the road.</p>\n\n<p>When buying a bike, going second hand is the smartest choice. Second hand bikes usually still ride like a charm, and their fair price makes them easily replaceable should something happen to your bike. All you need is that the lights work on the front and back, as it’s legally required to have bike lights on in the dark. Getting a solid second lock for your bike is also a smart move, as carelessly parked bikes are easily stolen. In Rotterdam, there are a few places where you can score (refurbished) second hand bikes for a range of budgets. On your right is a list of locations.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><h3><strong>Piekfijn</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Piekfijn is a good second hand thrift shop that sells everything from furniture to clothes and bikes, and they have addresses throughout the city.</p>\n\n<h5>MARINIERSWEG 255 (CITY CENTER)</h5>\n\n<p>Phone No. 010-2677772</p>\n\n<h5>ALUMINIUMSTRAAT 6 (PRINS ALEXANDERPOLDER)</h5>\n\n<p>Phone No. 010-2677773</p>\n\n<h5>WOLPHAERTSBOCHT 246 (CHARLOIS)</h5>\n\n<p>Phone No. 010-2677771</p></li>\n<li><h3><strong>PLUSPUNT</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Up in the north of the city (near Blijdorp Zoo), there is another second hand store.</p>\n\n<h5>NOORDHAVENKADE 142</h5>\n\n<p>Phone No. 010-4676614</p></li>\n<li><h3><strong>MEGABIKE</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In Kralingen, it’s worth going to Megabike, which is a stone’s throw away from metro stop Oostplein.</p>\n\n<h5>BURGEMEESTER VAN WALSUMWEG 2</h5>\n\n<p>Phone No. 010-4137435</p></li>\n</ol>"}, "data/views/sg/Bird": function(exports, require, module) {module.exports = "<h4><a href=\"http://BIRD-ROTTERDAM.NL\">BIRD-ROTTERDAM.NL</a></h4>\n\n<p>Bird, located close to central station, is a trendy alternative to the large night clubs in Rotterdam.

Membership is free but the competition is fierce, so here are a few guidelines to increase your chances of success in the wilderness of the Rotter-dam labour market.</p>\n\n<p>To begin with, you are likely already familiar with Dutch culture, but there is more to it than meets the foreign eye: cycling your orange bike with a kapsalon in hand is not going to be of much help in a job interview. What could help you jump-start your career, however, is knowing more about the Dutch working culture. For example, in general every team member has an equal say and is expected to contribute to decision making processes, even as a new employee or intern. Note this is not to say suggestions won’t be publicly criticized... It is true the Dutch are extremely direct, but it should not be mistaken for rudeness (piece of advice: practice your poker face in advance). Another strong characteristic of the work environment in the Netherlands is agenda setting – if the meeting is not written down, it is as good\nas nothing. So make sure to plan well in advance and keep track of meetings meticulously.</p>\n\n<p>What about Rotterdam in particular, you ask? Well, you might have noticed the city has experienced some wear-and-tear throughout history, resulting in a very pragmatic work culture. More so in Rotterdam than elsewhere in the country, people have the attitude of rolling up their sleeves and getting things done, so hard working is the most desirable quality in a potential employee. Moreover, it is wise not to compare the modern outlook of Rotterdam with the petite cobblestone streets of Amsterdam – Rotterdammers are proud people; rightfully so, as the city has a playing field of its own. Too often the labour market of Rotter-dam is associated with the port alone, when in fact the available space and the break from traditional European old-town style has opened up numerous possibilities for daring architecture and other creative industries. Coupled with a globally recognized port, the local job market has something to offer a student of every faculty, so you don’t have to look far.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, the population of Rotterdam is one of the youngest and most international in the Netherlands meaning two things: first, there are a lot of job opportunities for talent from abroad, and second, you have to know how to present yourself to stand out of the crowd. That is where the initiatives like “Careers Made in Rotterdam” come into play. During this event, the international students are not only familiarized with the major sectors in Rotterdam, but also introduced to the Dutch culture and receive workshops on successful job hunting practices. Here at Expertise in Labour Mobility (ELM) we can’t stress enough how vital soft skills are for international graduates. Of course, studies abroad automatically add a sense of independence, open- mindedness and keenness to your CV, but you should know how to use that to your advantage – make sure the employers understand that leaving your comfort zone at home has made you a more adaptive and flexible person. Under no circumstances play down your unique foreign factor! That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t make an effort to learn Dutch, but you have something that local job applicants don’t, be it knowledge of a different language or of a different culture. It’s probably a good idea to read up on legalities concerning work permits in the Netherlands too, so that you have the information and answers ready in case a recruiter asks about it (better safe than sorry!).</p>\n\n<p>Although half of the ( job) hunt success depends on being in the right place at the right time, having the right ‘equipment’ matters just as much. A checklist of your strongest weapons should include a motivation letter customized for every company and position, and a concise 1-2 page CV in reverse chronological order. Once you have that polished and ready, you can find your target job position in Dutch newspapers, private and temporary recruitment agencies, company websites, and career fairs. More often than not, speculative applications prove to be an effective job hunting technique in the Netherlands. But don’t expect your Dutch recruiter to give up (more like sign up) without a fight – have answers ready about your leisure activities, strengths and weaknesses, as well as future goals for the interview.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that you are not alone in the “Job Hunters” club – don’t underestimate the power of networking with your fellow internationals and locals who know their way around Rotterdam. To make you a job hunt pro, ELM offers a comprehensive career guide book “Looking for work in the Netherlands”. Readers of this International Student Guide can get their copy with a 5% discount by quoting this code <strong>ISG2014</strong>.

The scholarship ranges from 100.25 to 279.14 euros depending on living arrangements. There is a reason we are telling you this... International students can be eligible too!</p>\n\n<p>Stufi has provisions in place on top of the basic package to make it possible for all students to acquire their degree. Or you could go beyond the basics for the ‘aanvullende beurs’. Eligibility for this additional scholarship depends on the income of your parents, their marital status, number of siblings and what kind of higher education you pursue. You could expect 230-260 euros. As an extra deal from government, students can obtain up to 295.73 from the government each month as a loan. This must be paid back within 15 years of graduating. Interest is relatively low (fluctuating around the 1%), and the time allotted to pay back the loan is extensive so take that into consideration! All the above figures are from 2014, if you are reading this in 2015 or later the numbers might differ.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One major benefit of studiefinanciering is the student-OV card (OV is short for ‘openbaar vervoer’). The OV-card is used throughout Dutch public transportation. Students who are eligible for stufi can apply for a special student-OV card, giving them free or discounted transportation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some international students are eligible for all or part of\nstufi, however, it only applies to students from the EU, EEA and Switzerland. There are two ways international students can get stufi. Firstly, if you come from the EU, EEA or Switzerland and work a taxable 56 hours a month or more, you’re eligible for the whole package.</p>\n\n<p>The second way also requires you to come from the EU, EEA or Switzerland. However, you don’t have to be the one working 56 hours if one of your parents or your partner fulfills this requirement in the Netherlands. Are you from somewhere in the EU, EEA or Switzerland but not eligible for stufi? You might still be eligible for ‘loan tuition fees’, which requires sending a special form with the necessary evidence to the Dutch authorities (check the government website linked below for more information on this arrangement).</p>"}, "data/views/sg/StudySpots": function(exports, require, module) {module.exports = "<p>Most students who need peace and quiet to study usually study at home or at the library of their educational institution.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are three other great locations available to use as study space.</p>"}, "data/views/sg/Taxes": function(exports, require, module) {module.exports = "<h4>Costs of Living</h4>\n\n<p>Above we discussed tax remission, but what taxes actually exist?

This tax is charged by Gemeente Rotterdam and it is € 372.50 per household.</p>\n\n<h3>WATER TAX (WATERSCHAPSBELASTING)</h3>\n\n<p>Waterschapsbelasting is best translated as water tax. The tax is paid to create and maintain strong dikes and ensure the populous has clean water.

For one, teenagers are allowed to drink starting from age 18. Before this, you shouldn’t be in possession of alcohol if you are a law abiding citizen.</p>\n\n<p>At 18 all bets are off though, and buying hard liquor is as easy as going to the liquor store and flashing your ID. A bottle of vodka (depending on brand and quantity of either 70cl or 100cl) will set you back between 10 and 20 euros and a full crate of beer (24x33cl) from the supermarket is at most 13 euros (excluding deposit!). Drinking at home is much cheaper than drinking at a club, which is why pre-drinks are commonplace. Because pre- drinks are a must, most parties start to fill up around midnight.</p>\n\n<p>Keep this in mind to avoid a disappointing and boring few hours before the party really begins.</p>\n\n<p>Drinking can be fun, if it’s done in moderation (and alright, having one too many is fun too) but there’s one rule of thumb: it’s OK as long as you don’t bother anybody and keep the public peace. This goes for pretty much anything. Being drunk in a club is alright, but if you get to the point where you knock onto everybody around you, either sit down or go home. Need to puke? Take it outside or use the bathroom, but DO NOT puke inside the club. It’s just bad form and can ruin the night for many people. Same goes for fights; take your troubles outside and don’t bother everyone with it. Bouncers will not hesitate to throw you outside. This may seem like commonsense, but a surprising number of people don’t act accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Smoking inside clubs and bars is outlawed by the government, but some establishments (especially clubs) ignore this and allow their patrons to smoke inside. If you’re not sure, take a look around. Are people smoking and are bouncers not caring? If so, go ahead and light up! You can also ask a bartender if you can smoke in peace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outside the club is where things get delicate. Being drunk in public is officially a punishable offense, but walking or biking home from a party in the morning is A-OK as long as, again, you don’t bother anybody. Screaming matches and fights are often visited by our friends ‘de Politie’ and result in citations, fines and sometimes even a night in jail (although a night in jail is very, very rare and only happens for repeat offenders). Do not fret! It really isn’t all that strict. Just be a sensible citizen and the police will stay off your case.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Girls shouldn’t have to take extra precautions per se; Rotterdam is very safe for ladies to go out and have a good time, although caution is never a bad thing. It is rare for trouble to ensue, but one should always be careful, minimize going home alone after a night out and keep an eye on drinks.</p>"}, "data/views/sg/Toffler": function(exports, require, module) {module.exports = "<h4><a href=\"http://TOFFLER.NL\">TOFFLER.NL</a></h4>\n\n<p>Rotterdam is dubbed the techno- capital of Holland, and hosts a set of good underground-style clubs.
