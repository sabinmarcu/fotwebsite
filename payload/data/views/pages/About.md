# ABOUT ISR

#### DEAR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT OF ROTTERDAM,

Welcome to Rotterdam! Studying in Rotterdam is a chapter of your life that you will never forget! Do what makes you happy, strive for (academic) excellence, and enjoy all the little things that are part of your student experience. Before you lays an amazing opportunity to experience (a) great year(s), learn a lot, and meet friends for life! Time will fly and before you know it you have graduated and you’re applying for jobs. Until then, make the most of your student life.

__Why we exist?__ _International Students Rotterdam (ISR)_ was brought to life in the summer of 2011 because we wanted to improve the lives of all international students in Rotterdam; we wanted to create a Rotterdam that all international students can call home. We noticed that integrating into Dutch society can be difficult and we wanted to change that. We exist to make student life as an international easier and more enjoyable; we believe that Rotterdam is a beautiful city – full of opportunities – and we want our fellow international students to enjoy it as much as we do.

__What we do?__ We aim to be the platform that brings students together and helps them integrate into Dutch society. Our vision is to create a Rotterdam where all international students feel at home. All our activities can be divided into three categories. First, we try to connect students by organizing events. These events can mostly be classified as social, academic, cultural or sports and attempt to cover all aspects of student life; the upcoming year we will organize more than 50 events. Second, we aim to link students to organizations of their interest. This we do by attaching valuable organizations to our member’s card, offering our members exclusive deals or discounts throughout the city. Third, we aim to inform students about all the relevant matters regarding student life. We do this through our website and through this student guide that we write every year.

__Join the Family__. We represent more than 30 different cultures and what brings us together is that – just like you – we are international students in Rotterdam. As an international student you are one of us; ISR is your international family! 

We have all been through the process of integrating into a new country, culture and language. ISR’s network and services has helped us throughout this process. Any time you have a question or need some help, there is always an ISR member ready to help you out!

The upcoming year we will organize more than 50 events. Think of social drinks, personal development workshops, parties, festivals, company visits, sports tournaments, case competitions, food tastings, and more! These events are organized for you, so join one of our events to see how you can benefit from joining the family.

We are international students in Rotterdam, we are in this together! Do you want to know more about our family? Check [ISRotterdam](http://www.isrotterdam.com) to find out more!
