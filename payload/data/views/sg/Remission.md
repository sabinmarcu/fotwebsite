#### Getting tax returned

You may apply for remission of the water tax if your earnings are at the income support level or lower. The Regionale Belasting Groep will calculate how much disposable income you have by deducting your overheads from your income. Then the remission will be made accordingly.

If you are an international student without a job, you are earning below income support level! You should apply for remission within two months after receiving the tax letter. To ensure prompt processing of your application, we recommend that you respond within one month of having received the notice. Fill out a digital form (you need DigiD for that) or the remission section of the bill and return it without enclosing any documents. You will then receive a form that you need to fill out. Unfortunately, it will be in Dutch. Contact us if you need help with translation!
