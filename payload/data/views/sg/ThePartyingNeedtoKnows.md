#### GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

Before we tell you about the best bars and clubs, you need to know how to conduct yourself like a respectable Dutch person. For one, teenagers are allowed to drink starting from age 18. Before this, you shouldn’t be in possession of alcohol if you are a law abiding citizen.

At 18 all bets are off though, and buying hard liquor is as easy as going to the liquor store and flashing your ID. A bottle of vodka (depending on brand and quantity of either 70cl or 100cl) will set you back between 10 and 20 euros and a full crate of beer (24x33cl) from the supermarket is at most 13 euros (excluding deposit!). Drinking at home is much cheaper than drinking at a club, which is why pre-drinks are commonplace. Because pre- drinks are a must, most parties start to fill up around midnight.

Keep this in mind to avoid a disappointing and boring few hours before the party really begins.

Drinking can be fun, if it’s done in moderation (and alright, having one too many is fun too) but there’s one rule of thumb: it’s OK as long as you don’t bother anybody and keep the public peace. This goes for pretty much anything. Being drunk in a club is alright, but if you get to the point where you knock onto everybody around you, either sit down or go home. Need to puke? Take it outside or use the bathroom, but DO NOT puke inside the club. It’s just bad form and can ruin the night for many people. Same goes for fights; take your troubles outside and don’t bother everyone with it. Bouncers will not hesitate to throw you outside. This may seem like commonsense, but a surprising number of people don’t act accordingly.

Smoking inside clubs and bars is outlawed by the government, but some establishments (especially clubs) ignore this and allow their patrons to smoke inside. If you’re not sure, take a look around. Are people smoking and are bouncers not caring? If so, go ahead and light up! You can also ask a bartender if you can smoke in peace.

__Outside the club is where things get delicate. Being drunk in public is officially a punishable offense, but walking or biking home from a party in the morning is A-OK as long as, again, you don’t bother anybody. Screaming matches and fights are often visited by our friends ‘de Politie’ and result in citations, fines and sometimes even a night in jail (although a night in jail is very, very rare and only happens for repeat offenders). Do not fret! It really isn’t all that strict. Just be a sensible citizen and the police will stay off your case.__

Girls shouldn’t have to take extra precautions per se; Rotterdam is very safe for ladies to go out and have a good time, although caution is never a bad thing. It is rare for trouble to ensue, but one should always be careful, minimize going home alone after a night out and keep an eye on drinks.
