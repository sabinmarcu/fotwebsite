#### Finding an Accommodation

Finding student housing in Rotterdam can be a challenge. The demand is high, the supply low, and being an international student doesn’t make it easier. But don’t lose heart. Great apartments await you! We recommend you read on.

You can find an accommodation through your school. Your educational institution likely has arrangements with housing agencies. The Erasmus University Rotterdam, for example, has an agreement with Short Stay
Solutions - SSH. They offer furnished student rooms, located in or close to the centre of Rotterdam. You can rent these rooms up to a maximum of 12 months.

__Room prices vary depending on availability and circumstance. The closer the room is to the city the more expensive it will be. You can expect to pay between €500-600 a month. This includes all bills and utilities such as heating, water, energy, internet, and taxes.__

You may also look for accommodation through an independent landlord. Give yourself a large window of time to find the place of your dreams, as the process could take several months. There are many housing websites that act as intermediaries. English websites are listed below, join ISR to get discounts on agency fees!
