If you are an EU citizen, you need a valid passport and proof of address in order to open a bank account.

Some banks may, in addition, ask for a Citizen Service Number (BSN), and even proof of a residence permit application. In addition, non-EU citizens are sometimes requested to bring evidence of registration with the foreign police.

_ABN-AMRO_ is the only bank with online banking in English. ING, however, offers an English App for Smart-phones.
