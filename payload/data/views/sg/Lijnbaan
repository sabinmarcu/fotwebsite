#### The Shopping Street
Lijnbaan is the main shopping street in the greater Rotterdam area. It was opened in 1953 after the old district had been bombed during Second World War. Itâ€™s a car-free zone and was the first pedestrian shopping district in Europe. Most of the internationally known stores can be found here including brands such as _Tommy Hilfiger_, _Mango_, _H&M_ and _Zara_.
