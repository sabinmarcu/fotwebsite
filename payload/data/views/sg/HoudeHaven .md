#### The old sensation

Not far from Blaak you’ll find Oude Haven. This small marina is home to a variety of café’s, abundant with terraces and warm, welcoming bars. If you’re looking for a good steak or a simple pub inspired meal—this is the place to go. Prices can be steep, but the cozy feel and endless beer taps bring in crowds of students and otherwise. Be sure to check out _Kade 4_, _Stockholm Café_, and _Villa kakelbont_, and see for yourself!
