#### A search for part-time job

￼￼If you are looking for a part-time job, the catering and customer service industries are where you will have the highest chance of scoring a job. Most restaurants will accept internationals as dishwashers and, if you have cooking experience, you have a chance at being a cook. If you want to be in contact with customers, you should look at the more internationally oriented bars and restaurants. Breakaway Cafe is a good example; the spoken language is English. Call centers are a little less complicated than the catering industry; since they are often actively looking for internationals. They generally prefer students fluent in German, French, and Scandinavian languages.
