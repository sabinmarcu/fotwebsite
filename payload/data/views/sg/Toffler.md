Rotterdam is dubbed the techno- capital of Holland, and hosts a set of good underground-style clubs. Toffler is an old passenger tunnel turned techno paradise. The ceiling itself is an absolute trip, covered in diamond-patterned neon lights that change color with the music. Toffler is only open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. However, keep an eye out for the very popular monthly Toffler Thursdays, where a world- renowned techno DJ always takes the stage. Previous Toffler Thursday editions saw great names, such as Joris Delacroix, Arjuna Schiks, and Edu Imbernon
