#### Rules to Follow

__As we highlighted before, working as a student can benefit you big time! Remember, if you work for 56 hours per month (+/- 14 hours a week), you can claim studiefinanciering, â‚¬279,14 a month for 2014.__

International students from the EU/EEA or from Switzerland, have the same working rights as Dutch students. Also be aware if you plan to work in the Netherlands you must take out a basic Dutch health insurance.
