#### Stay in Contact

When in the Netherlands, you have the choice between prepaid and contract services for your phone. Prepaid operates on a system of prepaid credit. The idea is simple; When the money runs out, the phone stops working. Note that calls are more expensive with this option. Contract is perhaps a more long- term option, requires a more substantial time commitment. It may provide a better deal if calls and internet takes priority. It is possible to buy a sim card which you must then recharge with tickets available at Media Markt and grocery stores.

Another option is to add packages to your sim card which involves a monthly payment. These are referred to as contracts, however, it is possible to cancel them at any time.

Contracts allow you to choose the duration of your commitment to a provider. The longer the contract, the less you pay. Often you get a cell phone with it for free or at an acceptable price. You can compare rates at [www.gsminfo.nl](http://www.gsminfo.nl).
