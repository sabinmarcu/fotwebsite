Settlement on the grounds of what today is Rotterdam began in 900 AD. Being located at the lower end of the Rotte or Rotta as it was then know (from rot muddy and a water; muddy-water) the settlement had to deal with frequent flooding, which hindered further development and lead to the construction of several dams in the 14th century, hence the name Rotterdam.

__Rotterdam was granted city rights on July 7th, 1340 by count Willem IV of Holland, having a population of approximately 2000 inhabitants at the time.__

Around 1350 a shipping canal was build giving access to the cities in the north and allowing Rotterdam to grow into a port of some importance over the next 500 years. The city eventually became one of six cities to seat a chamber of the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC), better known as the Dutch East India Company. With the completion of the Nieuwe Waterweg in 1872 the city experienced a spur of growth, expanding the city and harbour to the south bank of the river. The Witte Huis, or white house, can be seen as a testament to the success of Rotterdam during those years, with a height of 45 meters, making it the highest building in Europe at the time of its completion.

During the Second World War the German army experienced fierce resistance from the Dutch, who only surrendered after the almost complete destruction of Rotterdam by the German Air-force, and the threat to bomb other Dutch cities. Rebuilding efforts began almost immediately after the war and continued until the 1970s. In the 1980s a new concept for an active architectural policy was developed, characterized by lively and modern architecture. Today Rotterdam is know as the “Manhattan on the Maas” and has the busiest port of the western hemisphere, second only to the port of Shanghai.
