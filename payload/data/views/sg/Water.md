#### Registration to Water Supplies

The only water provider in Rotterdam is Evides. When you move into your new home, you will receive a meter card.

You can complete registration through Evides official website with your personal registration number. Your registration number (registratienummer) can be found through either email or mail.

Make sure you find your meter numbers and fill them in. Once you have completed this process, you have registered successfully. If any problems arise, you can always fill out the meter numbers on the meter card itself, put the card in the mail and the postal service will deliver your information to Evides free of charge.
