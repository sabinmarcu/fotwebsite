LAST-MINUTE PURCHASE
Now that you know how to conduct yourself, you should know where to buy your alcohol. Note that normal liquor store such as Gall & Gall opens until 21.00 latest. If you missed out on your chance on purchasing drinks of your desire, you still have one last resort at a night shop.

Night shops, much like their name suggests, are open when the sun goes down and may offer much more reasonable prices than clubs and bars. We recommend you stock up here on your liquor and beer so you donâ€™t break the bank! And if you are ever so unprepared, the night shops are closed and you would still like to have a drink at home, there is one last resort : the beer courier. The website is in Dutch, check it out at [www.bier-koerier-rotterdam.nl](http://www.bier-koerier-rotterdam.nl).
