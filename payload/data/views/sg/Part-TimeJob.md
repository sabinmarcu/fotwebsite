#### For an Exta Income
As an international student in Holland, you might want to take a part-time job, just as Dutch students do. Rules are different depending on your nationality:

* If you are from a non-EU/EEA country, you will need a work permit for a part-time job. Also Dutch immigration law restricts the number of hours you may work. You may either do seasonal work full-time (but only in June, July and August; of course, you can name it “internship” but strictly speaking this is part-time since it requires a work permit), or you may work part-time throughout the rest of the year (but no more than ten hours a week); you may not do both. It is up to your employer or the employment agency to apply for your work permit from UWV WERKbedrijf.

* If you are a citizen of the EU/ EEA (except for Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania) and Switzerland, things are much easier. You do not need a work permit. There is no restriction on the number of hours you are allowed to work.
