#### The Marketplace

Blaak is most known amongst students as the place to be on Tuesdays and Saturdays as it is home to one of the largest markets in the Netherlands. Virtually anything you need can be found on this market. You can find Hollandâ€™s first indoor market, the world famous Cube Houses, as well as the only building left from medieval Rotterdam, the _Sint-Laurenskerk (church)_.
