__When taking up residence in Rotterdam, you are required to register in the municipal population within five days of your arrival.__

Registration takes place at City Hall with the department of Civil Affairs (Publiekszaken), located at Stadhuisplein. You are obliged to schedule an appointment via the website or by calling 14010. Be sure to mention that you want to register for the first time as you are coming from abroad. You will be sent an array of documents that you’ll need to fill out and bring to your meeting at City Hall. Provided you filled out all the documents, you will be awarded a Citizen Service Number (Burger Service Nummer – BSN). This number is a critical must have as it allows you to open a bank account or cell phone contract. If you want more in-depth help, send us an e-mail.
