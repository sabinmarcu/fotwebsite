#### Short-term Placement

An internship is any work placement or practical training arrangement that aims to give you experience of the world of work while you are studying. If you have already graduated, you will generally not be able to work as an intern in the Netherlands. If you are studying in the Netherlands and you are in the possession of a Dutch residence permit with the aim to study, you do NOT need a work permit to do an internship. However, an internship agreement is required if you are from a non-EU/EEA country. It is a formal agreement between three parties: the intern, the internship provider and the Dutch higher education institution. You may contact your international office or your faculty to sign the agreement on behalf of the Dutch higher education institution.
