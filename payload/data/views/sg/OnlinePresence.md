#### Make your Online Presence

The social network has made the world smaller and has brought people closer to each other. It can also help you build your network with people you do not know before. We only mention the most important one here. Yes, LinkedIn. At least there are there ways to leverage it:

* We can't ephasize the importance of your LinkedIN profile more nowadays. Your potential employers may look at it, headhunters may look at it. Spend some decent time on polishing your LinkedIN profile, and try to get recommendations from your previous boss, colleagues, professors or classmates.
* You can use LinkedIN to look for your alumni and build first connection with them
* You can check the profile of your potential interviewers before your interview. This can help you make better preparation and build personla connections with the inverviewers.
* You have 30 days free trial for LinkedIN Premium package where you can send InMail to anyone you want and whole lots of features for free. Of course it's your option to extend it by paying 22 euro per month, but at least try to leverage the free trial period do the 3 aforementioned things! Of course there are other ways to impress people online: making your personal website / blog and have quality contents there. This can prove your track record and your passion for what you are going to apply for.
