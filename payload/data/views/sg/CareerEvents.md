#### Show up in Career Events

Don’t be shy, just try. There are a couple of career events, like the national one held every year: _National Carriere Beurs_ ([http:// www.carrierebeurs.nl](http://http:// www.carrierebeurs.nl)). There must be at least held in your university, and some held in other universities. Just register them and go! It is a perfect time to know a lot of companies, agencies that you’ve probably never heard of. And try to talk to the right people at the stands! Always locate decision makers, in some cases are HRs, in others line Managers. Pitch to them: who you are, why they shall hire you! However do accept that it might not work every time as sometimes the company presented there has no vacancy at all. Then you save your time by eliminating this company from your later online search, correct? Do bring a CV with you, practice your 1-minute elevator pitch and ready to impress decision makers!
