#### HEALTH ISSUES

We are happy to report that health care in the Netherlands is of high quality. We advise you to register with a general practitioner (huisarts) in your neighborhood. In the last chapter, you can find link to access a list of all general practitioners in Rotterdam divided in terms of neighborhoods. 

Keep in mind that you will need to register with the general practitioner before you are able to make an appointment. We advise you to do this as soon as possible so you can make an appointment immediately when necessary. To register, call the doctor closest to you and make sure they speak English, then ask for a registration form. You will then have to take this form to the office along with an ID and insurance card.
