#### The Italian Cluster

__Home to the ‘Blaak Market’ held Tuesdays and Saturdays, is a massive rectangular plaza, lined with a number of yummy and diverse restaurants. You can expect a filling and rewarding meal for under 20 euros most everywhere you go. However, if you join ISR you’re in for an even sweeter deal! In many of the restaurants (13 at the time of writing) you can enjoy a main course, desert and a drink for just €10. Check the website for more information!__

Directly on the plaza sits Vapiano, an Italian restaurant to razz your dining experience. Upon entering you get a card, with which you can order salads, pizzas, pastas and more. You order, wait, and watch as your food is prepared before your eyes.

_Happy Italy_, the other Italian temptation, sits beside Vapiano, and offers a typical service with meals you can score under 15 euros. The interior is fresh and lively, while extensive seating is available outside in warm weather.

_Eazie_ will satisfy those craving Asian cuisine. With only 10 euros, you can fill your takeout box with meat/fish/chicken and veggies,
sauce, rice/noodles that will surely put a smile on your face. The food is consistently fresh and well worth the trip.

_Sumo_, while a more expensive option, (expect to pay 20-25 euros) provides endless options of fresh sushi, teppanyaki and tempura in a unique atmosphere. Prices during the day are much lower, so take advantage at lunchtime and reward yourself with this all-you-can-eat dream. Prices vary depending on the hour and day, so check out the website if you want to get the best deal.
