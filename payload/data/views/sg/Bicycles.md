#### GETTING A BIKE

Bicycles – These two-wheeled contraptions, or “fietsen” as they’re called in Dutch, are as much part of this country’s culture as cheese, windmills and tulips are (if you’re into stereotypes, that is). In fact, Holland counts over 18 million bikes for a mere 17 million Nederlanders, which is a pretty good indication of how silly for bikes the Dutch are. As an international student, one of your first steps should be laying claim to your first bike. Bikes are a great way of getting around and can save you a bunch of money on public transportation. If you are worried about safety, don’t fret: marked bike lanes are very common, and Dutch drivers are perfectly used to having bikes on the road.

When buying a bike, going second hand is the smartest choice. Second hand bikes usually still ride like a charm, and their fair price makes them easily replaceable should something happen to your bike. All you need is that the lights work on the front and back, as it’s legally required to have bike lights on in the dark. Getting a solid second lock for your bike is also a smart move, as carelessly parked bikes are easily stolen. In Rotterdam, there are a few places where you can score (refurbished) second hand bikes for a range of budgets. On your right is a list of locations.
