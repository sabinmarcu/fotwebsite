The Dutch Health Insurance Act requires everyone living in the Netherlands to take out a standard health insurance package called ‘basiszorgverzekering’. It covers basic medical costs such as visits to the general practitioner, costs for hospitalization, medications and most medical treatments. Dental care is NOT included. If you would like to insure yourself against dental care costs and other medical expenses, you must take out supplementary (aanvullende) insurance.

__If you are an EU/EEA citizen, or possibly a citizen of a country that has a healthcare treaty with the Netherlands, a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) suffices. It allows you to receive the same public
healthcare as a resident in all EEA countries (including Switzerland), either for free, or for a reduced cost. However, it is important to note that the EHIC is NOT a replacement for travel insurance. The EHIC covers any medical treatment that you might need during your stay due to sickness or an accident. It includes necessary treatment of chronic or pre-existing medical conditions.__

More information on the EHIC is available on the website of the European Commission.

When choosing health insurance, pay attention to the monthly premium and the deductible excess. The deductible excess is the cost you will have to pay
yourself in one year; everything above that will be paid by your insurance.
