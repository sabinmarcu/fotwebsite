#### Across Streets

Rotterdam has developed an extensive network of bus routes, especially in the city center. You will rarely find yourself in a location where you have to walk more than 5 minutes to get to a bus station. Bus is best for short travel across blocks and streets, or suburban areas, and it works with OV-chip card.

There is also a night bus service called the BOB-bus. They work on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, travelling between popular nightlife locations and residential areas. The night bus tickets cost €5.00 for a one-way trip, if you don’t have an OV chap card. For more information visit [www.bob-bus.nl](http://www.bob-bus.nl).
