GENERAL COSTS

First check if you have a double tariff. Do this by checking your meter closet to see if you have a single or double meter. Averages stay the same if you have a double meter, but the ‘high usage’ is about 65% of the average electricity consumption. Use the estimates below, provided by [www.nibud.nl](http://www.nibud.nl). 

An estimation is more difficult for gas as it depends on the type of house. As most students live in an apartment, we will use that as a basis for our analysis.
