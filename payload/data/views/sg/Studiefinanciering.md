#### Student Finance

‘_Studiefinanciering_’ or ‘_stufi_’ is a monthly grant handed out to Dutch students in the form of cheap public transportation, a subsidy for health insurance, and a fixed monthly allowance (the ‘basic scholarship’). The scholarship ranges from 100.25 to 279.14 euros depending on living arrangements. There is a reason we are telling you this... International students can be eligible too!

Stufi has provisions in place on top of the basic package to make it possible for all students to acquire their degree. Or you could go beyond the basics for the ‘aanvullende beurs’. Eligibility for this additional scholarship depends on the income of your parents, their marital status, number of siblings and what kind of higher education you pursue. You could expect 230-260 euros. As an extra deal from government, students can obtain up to 295.73 from the government each month as a loan. This must be paid back within 15 years of graduating. Interest is relatively low (fluctuating around the 1%), and the time allotted to pay back the loan is extensive so take that into consideration! All the above figures are from 2014, if you are reading this in 2015 or later the numbers might differ.

__One major benefit of studiefinanciering is the student-OV card (OV is short for ‘openbaar vervoer’). The OV-card is used throughout Dutch public transportation. Students who are eligible for stufi can apply for a special student-OV card, giving them free or discounted transportation.__

Some international students are eligible for all or part of
stufi, however, it only applies to students from the EU, EEA and Switzerland. There are two ways international students can get stufi. Firstly, if you come from the EU, EEA or Switzerland and work a taxable 56 hours a month or more, you’re eligible for the whole package.

The second way also requires you to come from the EU, EEA or Switzerland. However, you don’t have to be the one working 56 hours if one of your parents or your partner fulfills this requirement in the Netherlands. Are you from somewhere in the EU, EEA or Switzerland but not eligible for stufi? You might still be eligible for ‘loan tuition fees’, which requires sending a special form with the necessary evidence to the Dutch authorities (check the government website linked below for more information on this arrangement).
