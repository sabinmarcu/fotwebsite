#### Public Transport You Must Have

If you want to travel by bus, tram or metro inside of Rotterdam, you will be travelling with RET (Rotterdam’s transport company). You will need an OV-chip card for this. OV stands for “Openbaar Vervoer,” which is simply translated to public transport.

The RET offers disposable chip cards for single use that are ideal for tourists, but we advise you to acquire a personal OV-chip card. It only costs €7.50, it can be used across the Netherlands, and will make travelling a lot easier. Travelling with an OV is also cheaper than without, so it is definitely worth the investment. To apply for an OV-chip card, visit [www.ov-chipkaart.nl](http://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/). The website is available in English and the instructions are easy to follow.
