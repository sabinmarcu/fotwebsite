We list major websites to find internships / positions as follow:

1. __HOITALENT.COM__

    The largest job portal for international talents in the Netherlands. Simple, neat and to the points. All of its jobs/internships do not require Dutch. Also, it directs you to the employer job post page, which saves you a lot of time. Therefore, if you do speak Dutch quite well / at all, and look for an entry / mid levels jobs (HoiTalent only have jobs requiring up to 5-year work experience), this is a must choice!
2. __AGENCY WEBSITES__

    There are several traditional nation-wide job agencies like Randstad, Tempo Team. You can find positions via their website or by visiting their offices in person. Please not that usually there are very limited positions for non-Dutch speakers, or for graduates without any work experience.
3. __INDEED.NL__

    This is the Dutch version of the largest job search engine in the world. It may have the most complete database for jobs. But the down side of a search engine is that you have to know what you are looking for, rather than using filters to narrow down to specific areas. Another annoying thing is that you cannot easily identify which jobs accept non-Dutch speaking people.
4. __LINKEDIN__

    More and more companies tend to post positions in their Linkedin page. If you already have a LInkedin profile, this is a nice way. The filters and search engine there are quite good. However, it does not have complete vacancies especially for those small and medium- sized companies. Also, you need to click into each job by yourself to identify whether they accept non-Dutch speaking applicants.
5. __JOBBIRD.COM / NATIONALEVACATUREBANK.NL__

    These are two largest local websites. Very useful if you can speak Dutch: >90% of jobs require Dutch. Also please note that somehow their jobs are selective - it may not include complete positions from some big names like Shell, ASML.
6. __INTEGRAND.NL__

    This student foundation has a lot of internship positions which are not publicly posted. Asa trend, more and more non-Dutch speaking internships are offered.
